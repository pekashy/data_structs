    read - Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields.

SYNOPSIS
    read [-ers] [-a array] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields.
    
    Reads a single line from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD
    if the -u option is supplied.  The line is split into fields as with word
    splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME, the second
    word to the second NAME, and so on, with any leftover words assigned to
    the last NAME.  Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word
    delimiters.
    
    If no NAMEs are supplied, the line read is stored in the REPLY variable.
    
    Options:
      -a array	assign the words read to sequential indices of the array
    		variable ARRAY, starting at zero
      -d delim	continue until the first character of DELIM is read, rather
    		than newline
      -e		use Readline to obtain the line in an interactive shell
      -i text	Use TEXT as the initial text for Readline
      -n nchars	return after reading NCHARS characters rather than waiting
    		for a newline, but honor a delimiter if fewer than NCHARS
    		characters are read before the delimiter
      -N nchars	return only after reading exactly NCHARS characters, unless
    		EOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any delimiter
      -p prompt	output the string PROMPT without a trailing newline before
    		attempting to read
      -r		do not allow backslashes to escape any characters
      -s		do not echo input coming from a terminal
      -t timeout	time out and return failure if a complete line of input is
    		not read withint TIMEOUT seconds.  The value of the TMOUT
    		variable is the default timeout.  TIMEOUT may be a
    		fractional number.  If TIMEOUT is 0, read returns success only
    		if input is available on the specified file descriptor.  The
    		exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded
      -u fd		read from file descriptor FD instead of the standard input
    
    Exit Status:
    The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out,
    or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.

NAME
    readonly - Mark shell variables as unchangeable.

SYNOPSIS
    readonly [-af] [name[=value] ...] or readonly -p

DESCRIPTION
    Mark shell variables as unchangeable.
    
    Mark each NAME as read-only; the values of these NAMEs may not be
    changed by subsequent assignment.  If VALUE is supplied, assign VALUE
    before marking as read-only.
    
    Options:
      -a	refer to indexed array variables
      -A	refer to associative array variables
      -f	refer to shell functions
      -p	display a list of all readonly variables and functions
    
    An argument of `--' disables further option processing.
    
    Exit Status:
